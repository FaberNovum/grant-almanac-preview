  <h1>The Grant Almanac</h1>
  <div class="subtitle">Concentrated Wisdom from @retirementkeys</div>
  <div class="author">Grant Lannin</div>
  <div class="bio">designer of systems, lover of you</div>
  <div class="preview-badge">Preview &mdash; Foreword + Chapter 1</div>
</div>

<div class="content" id="content">
<h1 id="foreword">Foreword</h1>
<p>In December 2021, a designer of systems began sharing wisdom on
Twitter. Over the next three years, Grant Lannin would post thousands of
observations about money, relationships, personal growth, and the
architecture of a well-lived life. Each tweet was a small
seed—deceptively simple, often poetic, always intentional.</p>
<p>This almanac is what happened when we planted all those seeds in the
same garden and watched to see what grew.</p>
<h2 id="the-making-of-this-book">The Making of This Book</h2>
<p>What you’re holding is an experiment in applied knowledge synthesis.
We ingested over 2,700 tweets through the X API, mapped them into a
hypergraph database using hypabase, identified the conceptual threads
that connected them, and let the structure emerge organically. The
result: fifteen interconnected chapters spanning 5,600+ connections
between ideas.</p>
<p>This isn’t a traditional book where one person sits down to write
from beginning to end. It’s something stranger and perhaps more honest—a
map of a mind in motion, rendered visible through the mathematics of
connection. Where Grant’s ideas clustered densely, chapters formed.
Where concepts bridged across domains, we found the throughlines that
make his philosophy coherent.</p>
<h2 id="what-youll-find-here">What You’ll Find Here</h2>
<p>The chapters flow from the internal to the external, from foundation
to expression:</p>
<p><strong>Chapters 1-7</strong> build the inner architecture—mindset,
self-awareness, authenticity, and the systems that support sustainable
growth. Grant’s philosophy begins with the self, but not the self as
isolated ego. Rather, the self as system: observable, designable,
improvable.</p>
<p><strong>Chapters 8-11</strong> explore how we move through the
world—relationships, productivity, psychology, and the management of our
finite energy. Here you’ll find Grant’s most practical wisdom, grounded
in the reality that we’re always in relationship: to others, to our
work, to time itself.</p>
<p><strong>Chapters 12-15</strong> expand to the existential—life
philosophy, decision-making, spirituality, and the deeper questions of
meaning and purpose. This is where Grant’s systems thinking meets his
evident love for the human experience in all its complexity.</p>
<p>The chapter on Money Mindset sits deliberately at the center,
bridging the personal and the practical. Because in Grant’s world, money
is never just money—it’s energy, freedom, stored time, and a reflection
of values.</p>
<h2 id="the-spirit-of-the-work">The Spirit of the Work</h2>
<p>“Designer of systems, lover of you.” Grant’s Twitter bio captures
something essential. His philosophy is both rigorously structural and
deeply humanistic. He believes in optimization <em>and</em> in grace. In
discipline <em>and</em> in surrender. In building better systems
<em>and</em> in leaving space for mystery.</p>
<p>Reading through the corpus of his work, certain patterns emerge: an
almost spiritual reverence for simplicity, a conviction that most
problems are design problems, and an unwavering belief that people can
change—not through force, but through the patient redesign of the
systems that shape them.</p>
<p>His voice is distinctive: direct without being harsh, wise without
pretension, systematic without losing sight of the human. He writes like
someone who has done the work and continues to do it.</p>
<h2 id="a-living-document">A Living Document</h2>
<p>This almanac captures Grant’s philosophy as of its publication,
synthesized from tweets through early 2025. But Grant continues to post,
think, and evolve. Each new tweet enters the knowledge graph,
potentially creating new connections, strengthening existing themes, or
revealing entirely new territories.</p>
<p>Future editions will reflect this growth. Consider this Volume 1 of
an ongoing project—a snapshot of a living philosophy, certain to deepen
and expand as more data flows in and the graph reveals new patterns.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-this-book">How to Use This Book</h2>
<p>You can read it cover to cover, or you can dive into whichever
chapter calls to you. The chapters are interconnected—just like the
tweets that built them—so you’ll find threads that pull you from one
domain to another. That’s by design. Grant’s philosophy resists neat
compartmentalization because life itself does.</p>
<p>What matters most is that you engage with the ideas, test them
against your own experience, and use what serves you. Grant would want
nothing less.</p>
<p>This is his garden. Walk through it slowly. Notice what blooms.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-1-mindset">Chapter 1: Mindset</h1>
<p>Your life is exactly what your mind will allow it to be. Not what
circumstances allow. Not what your résumé allows. Not what your past
allows. What your <em>mind</em> allows.</p>
<p>And right now, your mind is probably fucking with you.</p>
<p>It’s telling you things are harder than they are. It’s inventing
competitions that don’t exist. It’s manufacturing hesitations about
things you actually want. It’s running psychological programs in the
background that quietly sabotage everything you touch. Most people spend
their entire lives imprisoned by these invisible barriers, never once
questioning whether the walls are even real.</p>
<p>They’re not.</p>
<h2 id="the-intelligence-trap">The Intelligence Trap</h2>
<p>Here’s something most people get backwards:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Balls + dumb = successful. Smart + balls = hypersuccessful. Smart +
no balls = monstrously depressed. IQ prob isn’t ur problem”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Intelligence without courage is a curse. You’re smart enough to see
all the ways things could go wrong. Smart enough to calculate risk with
precision. Smart enough to generate sophisticated reasons why you
shouldn’t move. And all that intelligence just builds a more elaborate
prison.</p>
<p>The skills you actually need aren’t the ones you think. When normies
think of “skills,” they only conceptualize physical-world related
things—the hard skills, the credentials, the technical knowledge. But
the skills that determine whether you win or lose are internal:
emotional regulation, creating a vision for yourself, managing your own
energy, reframing internal narratives, policing your own thought
patterns.</p>
<p>Most people are trying to develop the wrong skills entirely. They’re
taking courses and collecting certificates while the real battle—the one
that determines everything—is happening inside their own head.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Ur life will 100x in speed when u stop being afraid to guess. What’s
answer here? Just make ur best guess &amp; go. Normies think (probably
because of school brainwashing) there is a ‘magical correct answer out
there that I don’t know’. Nope. It always just feels like a guess.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>School trained you to believe there’s always a correct answer and
that not knowing it makes you inadequate. Real life doesn’t work like
that. The most successful people aren’t the ones who wait until they’re
certain—they’re the ones who got comfortable with the fact that it
<em>always</em> feels like guessing. They just guess faster and adjust
as they go.</p>
<h2 id="soul-level-commitment">Soul-Level Commitment</h2>
<p>There’s a difference between wanting something intellectually and
wanting it at a soul level. Most people have never experienced the
second one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When you truly want it, you’ll get it. Ur kinda worried now that u
might not get it but its more of an intellectual worry. Not a soul
worry. U haven’t TRULY decided cuz u don’t TRULY want it yet. The moment
you truly decide, it will come quicker &amp; more effortlessly than
you”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You say you want things. You make plans. You set goals. But
underneath, there’s hesitation. Internal resistance. A part of you that
isn’t sure, that wants to keep escape routes open, that’s protecting
yourself from potential failure or embarrassment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Nothing is hard to get if you GENUINELY, at a soul level, commit to
getting it. Issue is the % of people that have ever soul-committed to
anything is like .00000000000000001%. This is most people’s ‘biggest
issue’—inability to clear out all of the internal hesitancies”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Soul-level commitment means no backup plans. No mental escape
hatches. No “well, if this doesn’t work out…” It means making something
so non-negotiable that your entire being reorganizes around it. The
moment you do this—the moment you truly decide—reality starts conforming
to match.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The second you make an absolute decision about something is the
second the universe starts enacting it for you. God hides the magic of
his intelligent design behind a declaration of 100% conviction. Only
pure, absolute certainty at the core of you unlocks it. An amazing
feature.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn’t mysticism. It’s psychology. When you’re genuinely
committed, you stop self-sabotaging. You stop generating reasons to
quit. You stop looking for permission. Your brain shifts from “should
I?” to “how?” and suddenly everything that seemed impossible becomes a
logistics problem.</p>
<h2 id="the-competition-illusion">The Competition Illusion</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“There is genuinely zero competition to anything. It’s actually
fucking hilarious. If you give even the slightest fuck about anything
you’ll run laps. If you press the absolute tippy-tippy-top of ur toe to
the gas the world just crumbles in front of u &amp; gives u what u
want.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most people don’t actually try. They go through motions. They do the
minimum. They protect their ego by never fully committing, so if they
fail, they can tell themselves “well, I wasn’t really trying
anyway.”</p>
<p>You’re competing against that. Against people who are protecting
themselves from their own potential. Against people who care more about
looking good than being good. Against people whose self-image won’t
allow them to appear foolish, so they never attempt anything that might
make them look stupid.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The people who ‘make it’ are usually hyper-savage in a way that a
normie mind simply can’t conceptualize. Especially because these people
can put on the ‘blend in’ facade &amp; will come off to you as
semi-normal &amp; relatable. But u better believe that person is
aggressively softening”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The winners you see aren’t magical. They’re just willing to be more
aggressive, more persistent, more shameless about going after what they
want. They’ve accepted something you haven’t yet: that getting what you
want requires you to be willing to look ridiculous, fail publicly, and
push through anyway.</p>
<h2 id="the-shame-threshold">The Shame Threshold</h2>
<p>This is where most people break.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you can just accept the fact everything you want will require you
to go through a temporary shamerape then you can quite literally do
anything. It will drench your entire being &amp; it will fucking suck
but it’s only temporary and on the other side of it is the exact thing
you want”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every meaningful thing you want sits on the other side of potential
embarrassment. Starting a business means risking public failure.
Pursuing someone means risking rejection. Creating anything means
risking criticism. Your mind magnifies this risk into something
catastrophic, when in reality it’s just temporary discomfort.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Your life will rise in direct proportion to the amount of ‘potential
shame’ you can put on the chopping block &amp; slice through with power
&amp; tenacity. Have to avoid tip-toeing towards what u want &amp; drop
nuts on counter to get it. Let cards fall where they may.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The equation is simple: The more willing you are to risk looking
stupid, the more you can attempt. The more you can attempt, the more you
can achieve. Your tolerance for temporary embarrassment is the
constraint on your entire life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you remove shame around your desires &amp; just stop suppressing
them while openly going after them your life gets a lot better. No need
to act like you’re a tame little choir boy. We are all beasts.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You’re pretending to be smaller than you are because you think the
real you is too much. Too intense, too ambitious, too weird, too
aggressive, too something. You’ve learned to soften yourself, to blend
in, to be palatable. And in doing so, you’ve locked away the exact
energy that would make you magnetic and unstoppable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“U run from urself cuz u think if u enact ur full self it will be too
much for people. Fuck it. Flip ur psyche. Go from ‘im scared to stand
out’ to ‘watch me stand out’. ‘I dont wanna rock the boat’ to ‘imma rock
the boat so hard its gonna be a troll’. Lean IN, not out.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-uncertainty-feature">The Uncertainty Feature</h2>
<p>Most people think uncertainty is the enemy. It’s actually the entire
point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If u knew how everything would play out u’d never grow. Massive
uncertainty (what people fear the most) is quite literally the single
best aspect/feature in the entire fucking game. Throw urself in &amp;
play”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The not-knowing is where all the growth happens. The discomfort of “I
don’t know if this will work” is the sensation of becoming someone new.
If everything was guaranteed, you’d never develop courage,
resourcefulness, or resilience. You’d never discover what you’re capable
of.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The secret is really just being unafraid to fuck up, unafraid to
admit you’re wrong, unafraid to admit you don’t know what you’re doing.
And to then push through despite all of that and learn everything you
need to learn until you get there. Feeling like ‘uhhh i don’t really
know’ is the ENTIRE game”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Successful people aren’t the ones who figured it all out before they
started. They’re the ones who were willing to look clueless, fuck up
repeatedly, and keep moving anyway. They’ve made peace with not knowing.
More than that—they’ve realized that “I don’t know, but I’ll figure it
out” is actually the most powerful position you can take.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The ‘secret’ is when you jump, the net appears. But in reality
there’s not really a jump &amp; a net isn’t really even required. What
your mind creates/perceives as an ‘infinite fall into a never-ending
abyss of unknown &amp; scary’ is actually nothing. U step outside of it
&amp; realize”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your mind dramatizes risk. It takes a small step and projects it as
catastrophe. But when you actually move, you discover the horror was
imagined. The fall you feared doesn’t exist. You just step into a
slightly uncomfortable new situation and… handle it. Like you always
do.</p>
<h2 id="the-confidence-equation">The Confidence Equation</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“NEVER lose your fucking confidence. You’re an imperfect person
operating forward courageously through the darkness of infinite guesses
where every wrong move has heavy consequences. Most simply not built for
that shit. But YOU are. Built different fr fr. Forgive yourself for
all”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Confidence isn’t about being certain you’ll succeed. It’s about being
certain you can handle whatever happens. It’s trusting yourself to
figure things out, to recover from failures, to adapt when things go
wrong.</p>
<p>Most people lose confidence because they tie it to outcomes. They
tried something, it didn’t work, so they conclude they’re inadequate.
But the real confidence comes from knowing you’re the kind of person who
keeps trying until something works.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you view the world in terms of ‘shots on goal’, L’s basically
cease to exist. If something doesn’t work out in THAT MOMENT it’s either
the percentages running themselves out or it’s in progress &amp; is on
its way to victory. ‘The win has been slightly delayed’. More shots”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the reframe that changes everything. You’re not
failing—you’re collecting data. You’re not losing—you’re still in the
game. Every attempt that doesn’t work is just proof you’re actually
trying, which puts you ahead of 99% of people who are still preparing to
prepare.</p>
<h2 id="taking-your-power-back">Taking Your Power Back</h2>
<p>The most important mindset shift is simple: stop blaming anything
outside yourself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Train yourself to never blame anything outside of yourself, ever.
The moment you catch yourself blaming anything that isn’t
you—immediately ask ‘but where am i failing here &amp; how can I get
better? What do i need to learn more about and get better at?’ YOU are
only thing you control”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>External blame feels good temporarily. It protects your ego. But it
also makes you powerless. If your problems are someone else’s fault, you
can’t fix them. You’re waiting for the world to change, for people to
treat you differently, for circumstances to improve.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you replaced every excuse you ever make with the core question(s)
of ‘how is this problem resulting from a leadership issue on my end
&amp; what can i do right now to patch up this problem, no matter how
poorly?’ You’ll 10x your life in 12 calendar months. Take your power
back.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you assume everything is your fault—not in a self-flagellating
way, but in an empowering way—you suddenly have leverage. You can’t
control the economy, other people, or circumstances. But you can control
how you think, what you do, and how you respond. That’s actually all you
need.</p>
<h2 id="the-ultimate-reframe">The Ultimate Reframe</h2>
<p>At the core of Grant’s philosophy on mindset is one radical
possibility:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“WHAT IF IT WORKS OUT MORE PERFECTLY THAN YOU EVER FUCKING
IMAGINED”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your mind is biased toward catastrophizing. It’s generating
worst-case scenarios constantly, trying to protect you from potential
threats. But it’s equally possible—maybe more possible—that things work
out better than you can currently conceptualize.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What if perfection magically inserts itself into your life in nooks
&amp; crannies that you couldn’t even previously conceptualize? Beauty
&amp; intelligent design goes beyond the conscious mind. Have faith in
beauty”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What if the risk you’re afraid to take leads to the exact life you
want? What if the thing you’re procrastinating on is the door to
everything? What if you’re one decision away from a completely different
trajectory?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You have so much potential. Don’t allow yourself to squander it. Get
pissed &amp; force your dreams to conform to your will. Nobody will hand
you the map. U gotta draw it with a shitty crayon &amp; then execute
like a fucking savage. U have everything u need, just gotta send it”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You already have everything you need. The resources, the
intelligence, the capability—it’s all there. The only thing standing
between you and the life you want is your willingness to act despite
uncertainty, to tolerate temporary discomfort, to trust yourself enough
to jump.</p>
<p>Your mindset isn’t a fixed thing you’re stuck with. It’s a tool you
can sharpen. A lens you can adjust. A set of programs you can
rewrite.</p>
<p>The question is: will you?</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="key-principles">Key Principles</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Intelligence without courage is depression.</strong> Your
IQ isn’t your problem—your unwillingness to act despite uncertainty
is.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Soul-level commitment unlocks reality.</strong> True
decision-making isn’t intellectual—it’s eliminating all internal
hesitation and making something non-negotiable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Shame tolerance determines success.</strong> Everything
you want is on the other side of potential embarrassment. Your
willingness to risk looking stupid is the constraint on your entire
life.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>External blame is powerlessness.</strong> The moment you
take full responsibility for everything, you gain the leverage to change
everything.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Uncertainty is the feature, not the bug.</strong> The
discomfort of not knowing is where all growth happens. Being comfortable
with “I’ll figure it out” is the real skill.</p></li>
